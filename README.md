# Typology

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/max0484/max/_apis/build/status/MaxDesiatov.Typology?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/max0484/max/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Typology is a work in progress attempt to implement type checking of Swift in Swift itself.
Currently it uses [SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax) as a parser, but is ready
to switch to other pure Swift parsers in the future when any are available.

## Goals

* **Education**: understanding how type checking can be implemented in a Swift
  compiler
* **User Experience**: finding the best way to report type errors and to improve
  related developer tools
* **Research and Experimentation**: prototyping advanced features that could be
  fully developed within Swift's type system.

## How does it work?

Same as [the type checker in Apple's Swift
compiler](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/TypeChecker.rst),
Typology relies on the fact that you can express [type
systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley–Milner_type_system) with a set of constraints
on types that are resolved through [unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)).
