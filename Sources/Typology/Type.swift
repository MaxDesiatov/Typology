  /** A type constructor is an abstraction on which generics system is built.
   It is a "type function", which takes other types as arguments and returns
   a new type. `Type.constructor("Int", [])` represents an `Int` type, while
   `Type.constructor("Dictionary", ["String", "Int"])` represents a
   `[String: Int]` type (`Dictionary<String, Int>` when desugared).

   Examples:

   * `Int` and `String` are nullary type constructors, they
   don't take any type arguments and already represent a ready to use type.

   * `Array` is a unary type constructor, which takes a single type argument:
   a type of its element. `Array<Int>` is a type constructor applied to the
   `Int` argument and produces a type for an array of integers.

   * `Dictionary` is a binary type constructor with two type arguments
   for the key type and value type respectively. `Dictionary<String, Int>` is
   a binary type constructor applied to produce a dictionary from `String` keys
   to `Int` values.

   * `->` is a binary type constructor with two type arguments for the argument
   and for the return value of a function. It is written as a binary operator
   to produce a type like `ArgsType -> ReturnType`. Note that we use a separate
   enum `case arrow(Type, Type)` for this due to a special treatment of function
   types in the type checker.

   Since type constructors are expected to be applied to a correct number of
   type arguments, it's useful to introduce a notion of
   ["kinds"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_(type_theory)). At compile time
   all values have types that help us verify correctness of expressions, types
   have kinds that allow us to verify type constructor applications. Note that
   this is different from metatypes in Swift. Metatypes are still types,
   and metatype values can be stored as constants/variables and operated on at
   run time. Kinds are completely separate from this, and are a purely
   compile time concept that helps us to reason about generic types.

   All nullary type constructors have a kind `*`, you can think of `*` as a
   "placeholder" for a type. If we use `::` to represent "has a kind"
   declarations, we could declare that `Int :: *` or `String :: *`. Unary type
   constructors have a kind `<*> ~> *`, where `~>` is a binary operator for a
   "type function", and so `Array :: <*> ~> *`, while `Array<Int> :: *`. A
   binary type constructor has a kind `<*, *> ~> *`, therefore
   `Dictionary :: <*, *> ~> *` and `Dictionary<String, Int> :: *`.

   In Typology's documentation we adopt a notation for kinds similar to the one
   used in the widely available content on the type theory, but slightly
   modified for Swift. Specifically, type constructors in Swift don't use
   [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying), and Typology uses `~>`
   for type functions on the level of kinds, compared to `->` for value
   functions used on the level of types. Compare this to the type theory papers,
   which commonly use `->` on both levels. We find the common approach confusing
   in the context of Swift type system.
